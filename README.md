# C++ Course Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive Computer Programming with  C++ course designed to take you through the intricacies of the C++ programming language. This course is structured into individual lessons, each focusing on specific topics to provide a thorough understanding of C++.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a lesson. Inside each lesson directory, you'll find subdirectories for various topics covered in that lesson. Each topic has its own `[topicname].md` file that delves into the details of that particular topic and src folder that contains the source code for the topic.

## Getting Started

To begin with the course, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KamoliddinS/CppUniversityTutorialSeries.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Lesson**:
   ```bash
   cd [lesson_directory_name]
   ```

   For example, to navigate to the first lesson:
   ```bash
   cd 1.Introduction
   ```

3. **Access Topics**:
   Inside each lesson directory, navigate to the desired topic's directory to access its `[topicname].md` file.

   For example, to access the first topic of the first lesson:
   ```bash
   cd 1.HelloWorld
   code . # or open the directory in your preferred editor
   ```

## Course Lessons

Here's a brief overview of the lessons and the topics they cover:

- **[Introduction](./1.Introduction/README.md)**: This lesson provides a basic understanding of C++ programming. It covers topics like setting up a development environment, naming conventions, and running the code.


- **[CPP Programming Structure](./2.CPPProgrammingStructure/README.md)**: This lesson covers the fundamental components of a C++ program, such as the `#include` directive, `main()` function,namespaces as well as fundamental types ( to help you stay in sync with tutorials in the lab). 

- **[CPP Data Storage Basics](./3.C++DataStorageBasics/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of data storage in C++, including variables, constants, and literals as well as arrays and vectors.

- **[Statments Operators](./4.StatementsOperators/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of statements and operators in C++, including arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators as well as conditional statements and loops.

- **[Control Flow](./5.ControllingProgramFlow/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of controlling program flow in C++, including conditional statements, loops, and jump statements.

- **[Characters and Strings](./6.CharacterStrings/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of characters and strings in C++, including character sets, character handling functions, and string handling functions.

- **[Functions](./7.Functions/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of functions in C++, including function declaration, function definition, function call, and function overloading.
- **[Pointer References](./8.PointerReferences/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of pointers and references in C++, including pointer declaration, pointer arithmetic, pointer and array, pointer and string, and reference declaration.

- **[OOP](./9.OOP/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of object-oriented programming in C++, including classes, objects, access modifiers, constructors, destructors, and static members.
- **[Operator Overloading](./10.OpertorOverloading/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of operator overloading in C++, including operator overloading, overloading unary operators, overloading binary operators, and overloading relational operators.


- **[Inheritance](./11.Inheritance/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of inheritance in C++, including inheritance, types of inheritance, and access specifiers.

- **[Polymorphism](./12.Polymorphism/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of polymorphism in C++, including polymorphism, function overloading, operator overloading, and function overriding.

- **[Smart Pointers](./13.SmartPointers/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of smart pointers in C++, including smart pointers, unique pointers, shared pointers, and weak pointers.

- **[Exception Handling](./14.ExceptionHandling/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of exception handling in C++, including exception handling, try block, catch block, and throw keyword.


- **[IO Streams](./15.IOStreams/README.md)**: This lesson covers the basics of I/O streams in C++, including I/O streams, standard streams, and file streams.


>To stay updated on the latest lessons and topics, git pull the repository regularly. 
> If you did some changes in the repository, you can stash them before pulling the repository and then apply them back after pulling the repository if you need it.
> ```bash
> git stash
> git pull
> git stash apply # or git stash pop if you want to remove the stash after applying it
