# C++ Course Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive Computer Programming with  C++ course designed to take you through the intricacies of the C++ programming language. This course is structured into individual lessons, each focusing on specific topics to provide a thorough understanding of C++.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into separate directories, with each directory representing a lesson. Inside each lesson directory, you'll find subdirectories for various topics covered in that lesson. Each topic has its own `[topicname].md` file that delves into the details of that particular topic and src folder that contains the source code for the topic.

## Getting Started

To begin with the course, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KamoliddinS/CppUniversityTutorialSeries.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Lesson**:
   ```bash
   cd [lesson_directory_name]
   ```

   For example, to navigate to the first lesson:
   ```bash
   cd 1.Introduction
   ```

3. **Access Topics**:
   Inside each lesson directory, navigate to the desired topic's directory to access its `[topicname].md` file.

   For example, to access the first topic of the first lesson:
   ```bash
   cd 1.HelloWorld
   code . # or open the directory in your preferred editor
   ```

## Course Lessons

Here's a brief overview of the lessons and the topics they cover:

- **[Introduction](./1.Introduction/README.md)**: This lesson provides a basic understanding of C++ programming. It covers topics like setting up a development environment, naming conventions, and running the code.


- **[CPP Programming Structure](./2.CPPProgrammingStructure/README.md)**: This lesson covers the fundamental components of a C++ program, such as the `#include` directive, `main()` function,namespaces as well as fundamental types ( to help you stay in sync with tutorials in the lab). 

>To stay updated on the latest lessons and topics, git pull the repository regularly. 
> If you did some changes in the repository, you can stash them before pulling the repository and then apply them back after pulling the repository if you need it.
> ```bash
> git stash
> git pull
> git stash apply # or git stash pop if you want to remove the stash after applying it
> ```

## Note

This course aims to provide a structured and in-depth understanding of C++ programming. By following along with the lessons and topics, you'll gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.
