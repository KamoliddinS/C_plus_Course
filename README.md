To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:

```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```

Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL of this repository.

### 4. Running the Code

To compile and run a C++ program, navigate to the `src` directory of the desired lesson. For instance:

```bash
cd Getting Started/src
```

Compile the code with:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
```

Replace `filename.cpp` with the name of the C++ file and `outputname` with whatever you wish to name the executable. Then, run the program with:

```bash
./outputname
```

## Lessons Overview

Each lesson has its own directory, and inside each directory is a `src` folder with the source code and a `README.md` file. The `README.md` will provide a title, a short description of the lesson, and instructions on how to run the specific code for that lesson.

---

Students can now navigate to individual lesson directories for further details and examples. For each lesson's README.md, you might want to provide the title, objectives, and any special compilation or runtime instructions. 

Good luck with your course!
