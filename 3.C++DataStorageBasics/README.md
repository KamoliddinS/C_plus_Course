# C++ Data Storage Basics

Welcome to the C++ Data Storage Basics guide! This README is designed to provide a brief overview of some fundamental concepts in C++ data storage. Each topic is linked to a detailed explanation to help you dive deeper and understand better.

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction_variable**: Variables are the building blocks of any program. They store data and help us manipulate it. This section will give you a bird's-eye view of the components that make up a C++ program. [Read more here](./1.Introduction_Variables/INTRODUCTION_VARIABLES.md).

2. **Built-in Primative Data Types**: C++ offers a variety of data types, from integers to characters to floating-point numbers. Understand the basics of these types and when to use them. [Dive into details here](./2.Built-inDataTypes/BUILT_IN_PRIMITIVE_DATA_TYPES.md)

3. Sizeof Variable: The `sizeof` operator helps us determine the size of a variable. Learn about its significance and how to use it. [Explore more here](./3.SizeofVariable/SIZEOFVARIABLES.md).

4. **Constants**: Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed. They're useful when you want to store data that shouldn't be modified. [Learn more about constants here](./4.Constants/CONSTANTS.md).

5. Arrays: Arrays are a collection of variables of the same type. They're useful when you want to store a large amount of data. [Read in detail here](./5.Arrays/ARRAYS.md).

6. Vectors: Vectors are a collection of variables of the same type. 
They are similar to arrays, but they can grow and shrink in size. [Discover more here](./6.Vectors/VECTORS.md).
