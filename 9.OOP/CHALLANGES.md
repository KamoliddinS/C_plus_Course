### Challenge 1: Hello, Object!
- **Objective**: Get familiar with class instantiation.
- **Task**: Create a `Greeter` class with a single method `sayHello()` that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Instantiate the class in `main()` and call the method.

### Challenge 2: Data Members
- **Objective**: Practice using data members within a class.
- **Task**: Create a `Counter` class with a private integer data member. Implement `increment()` and `getCount()` methods to manipulate and retrieve its value.

### Challenge 3: Basic Arithmetic Class
- **Objective**: Work with member functions performing arithmetic operations.
- **Task**: Create a `Calculator` class that provides methods to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers passed as arguments.

### Challenge 4: String Reverser
- **Objective**: Manipulate strings using a class.
- **Task**: Develop a `StringReverser` class with a method that takes a string and returns its reverse without using any built-in reverse functions.

### Challenge 5: Array Wrapper
- **Objective**: Manage array operations inside a class.
- **Task**: Create an `ArrayWrapper` class with methods to add an element, remove an element, and retrieve an element by index from a private array.

### Challenge 6: Basic Bank Account
- **Objective**: Simulate a bank account with deposit and withdrawal functions.
- **Task**: Create a `BankAccount` class with methods to `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and check `getBalance()`.

### Challenge 7: Temperature Converter
- **Objective**: Implement a utility class.
- **Task**: Design a `TemperatureConverter` class that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### Challenge 8: Simple Geometric Shape Area Calculator
- **Objective**: Apply geometric calculations using classes.
- **Task**: Develop a `ShapeAreaCalculator` class with static methods to calculate the area of a circle, square, and rectangle.

### Challenge 9: Custom String Concatenator
- **Objective**: Understand operator overloading.
- **Task**: Create a `MyString` class that overloads the `+` operator to concatenate two `MyString` objects containing string data.

### Challenge 10: Dynamic Stack
- **Objective**: Manage dynamic memory within a class.
- **Task**: Build a simple `Stack` class that implements push, pop, and top methods using a dynamic array for storage.
