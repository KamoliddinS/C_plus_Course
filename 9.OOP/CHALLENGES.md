1. **Student Class:**
   - Challenge: Create a `Student` class with private member variables for name, grade, and GPA. Include public member functions for a default constructor, a constructor that takes three arguments, a destructor, and a display function. The display function should display the student information in multiple lines. ( try to make it look nice)
   - Focus: This task will help you understand how to create a class with private member variables and public member functions.


2. **Constructor Overloading:**
   - Challenge: Design a `Rectangle` class with two private members: width and height. Create multiple constructors: a default constructor, a constructor that takes one argument (assumes a square), and a constructor that takes two arguments for width and height. Add a method to calculate the area of the rectangle.
   - Focus: This task will help you understand constructor overloading and how objects can be initialized in different ways.

3. **Dynamic String:**
   - Challenge: Create a `String` class that contains a private member variable for a character array. Include public member functions for a default constructor, a constructor that takes a `char` array as an argument, a destructor, and a display method. The display method should display the string character by character.
   - Room for improvement: 
   1. Length Method that returns the length of the string. 
   2. A function takes a char and returns the index of the first occurrence of that char in the string. 
   3. A function that takes a char and returns the index of the last occurrence of that char in the string. 
   4. A function that takes a char and returns the number of occurrences of that char in the string.
   5. A function that takes a char and replaces all occurrences of that char with another char.

   - Focus: This challenge will help you understand how to create a class that contains a dynamic array and how to write a destructor.
