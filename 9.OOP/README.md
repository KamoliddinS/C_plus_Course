# Overview of Object-Oriented Programming with C++

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the learning and mastery of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. This resource is crafted to provide students and enthusiasts with a solid foundation in OOP concepts using C++ as the medium for instruction. Our journey delves into the creation, manipulation, and understanding of classes and objects, which are the cornerstone of OOP.

## Introduction to OOP

We initiated our exploration with an introduction to the paradigms of OOP, discussing its four fundamental pillars: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

## Classes and Objects

Our journey continued with the definition and differentiation between classes and objects, using real-world metaphors to illustrate the relationship between a blueprint (class) and its instantiation (object).

## Declaring Classes and Creating Objects

We provided practical insights on how to declare a class, define its attributes and behaviors, and create instances of the class in the form of objects.

## Accessing Class Members

An in-depth look into the mechanisms of interacting with the members of a class, such as properties and methods, was covered, highlighting the significance of access control.

## Public and Private Access Specifiers

The repository contains detailed examples illustrating the use of public and private access specifiers, enforcing the principle of encapsulation by controlling the visibility and accessibility of class members.

## Implementing Member Methods

We've compiled examples demonstrating the implementation of member methods, both inline and outside the class definition, teaching through code how member methods are declared and defined to model class behaviors.

## Source Code Examples

Each topic is reinforced with source code examples that serve as both teaching aids and practical references for students. These examples aim to encourage learning by doing, providing a hands-on approach to understanding OOP concepts.
