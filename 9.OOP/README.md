# Overview of Object-Oriented Programming with C++

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the learning and mastery of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. This resource is crafted to provide students and enthusiasts with a solid foundation in OOP concepts using C++ as the medium for instruction. Our journey delves into the creation, manipulation, and understanding of classes and objects, which are the cornerstone of OOP.

## Introduction to OOP

We initiated our exploration with an introduction to the paradigms of OOP, discussing its four fundamental pillars: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

## Classes and Objects

Our journey continued with the definition and differentiation between classes and objects, using real-world metaphors to illustrate the relationship between a blueprint (class) and its instantiation (object).

[Read more about Classes and Objects](./2.ClassesAndObjects/README.md)

## Declaring Classes and Creating Objects

We provided practical insights on how to declare a class, define its attributes and behaviors, and create instances of the class in the form of objects.
[Read more about Declaring Classes and Creating Objects](./3.DeclaringClassandCreatingObjects/README.md)

## Accessing Class Members

An in-depth look into the mechanisms of interacting with the members of a class, such as properties and methods, was covered, highlighting the significance of access control.
[Read more about Accessing Class Members](./4.AccessingClassMembers/README.md)

## Public and Private Access Specifiers

The repository contains detailed examples illustrating the use of public and private access specifiers, enforcing the principle of encapsulation by controlling the visibility and accessibility of class members.
[Rear more about Public and Private Access Specifiers](./5.PublicAndPrivate/README.md)

## Implementing Member Methods

We've compiled examples demonstrating the implementation of member methods, both inline and outside the class definition, teaching through code how member methods are declared and defined to model class behaviors.
[Read more about Implementing Member Methods](./6.ImplementingMemberMethods/README.md)

## Constructors and Destructors

Constructors and destructors are special member methods that are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated and destroyed, respectively. We've provided examples of how to declare and define constructors and destructors, highlighting their importance in initializing and cleaning up class instances.
[Read more about Constructors and Destructors](./7.ConstructorsAndDestructors/README.md)

## Default Constructors

We've provided examples of how to declare and define default constructors, which are constructors that are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated without any arguments.
[Read more about Default Constructors](./8.DefaultConstructor/README.md)

## Overloading Constructors
Overloaded constructors are constructors that share the same name but differ in the number and/or type of parameters they accept. We've provided examples of how to declare and define overloaded constructors, highlighting their importance in initializing class instances with different sets of arguments.
[Read more about Overloading Constructors](./9.OverloadingConstructors/README.md)

## Constructor Initialization Lists
Constructor initialization lists are used to initialize class properties before the body of the constructor is executed. We've provided examples of how to use constructor initialization lists to initialize class properties, highlighting their importance in initializing class instances with different sets of arguments.
[Read more about Constructor Initialization Lists](./10.ConstructorInitList/README.md)

## Delegating Constructors
Delegating constructors are constructors that call other constructors to initialize class properties. We've provided examples of how to use delegating constructors to initialize class properties, highlighting their importance in initializing class instances with different sets of arguments.
[Read more about Delegating Constructors](./11.DelegatingConstructors/README.md)


## Constructor Parameters and Default Arguments
Constructor parameters are used to initialize class properties with values passed to the constructor. We've provided examples of how to use constructor parameters to initialize class properties, highlighting their importance in initializing class instances with different sets of arguments.
[Read more about Constructor Parameters and Default Arguments](./12.ConstructorsParamtersAndDefaultValues/README.md)

## Copy Constructors
Copy constructors are special constructors that are used to initialize a class instance with the values of another class instance. We've provided examples of how to declare and define copy constructors, highlighting their importance in initializing class instances with the values of other class instances.
[Read more about Copy Constructors](./13.CopyConstructor/README.md)

## Shallow vs. Deep Copying
Shallow copying is the process of copying the values of the properties of one class instance to another. Deep copying is the process of copying the values of the properties of one class instance to another, including any dynamically allocated memory. We've provided examples of how to perform shallow and deep copying, highlighting the differences between the two.
[Read more about Shallow ](./14.ShallowCopyingwithCopyConstr/README.md)
[Read more about Deep Copying](./15.DeepCopyingwithCopyConstructor/README.md)

## Move Constructors
Move constructors are special constructors that are used to initialize a class instance with the values of another class instance, leaving the other class instance in a valid but unspecified state. We've provided examples of how to declare and define move constructors, highlighting their importance in initializing class instances with the values of other class instances.
[Read more about Move Constructors](./16.MoveConstructor/README.md)

## The This Pointer
The this pointer is a special pointer that points to the current class instance. We've provided examples of how to use the this pointer to access class properties and methods, highlighting its importance in differentiating between class properties and local variables.
[Read more about The This Pointer](./17.ThisPointer/README.md)

## Using const with Classes
Const is a keyword that can be used to declare class properties and methods that cannot be modified. 
[Read more about Using const with Classes](./18.UsingconstwithClasses%20/README.md)

## Static Class Members
Static class members are class properties and methods that are shared by all class instances. 
[Read more about Static Class Members](./19.StaticClassMembers/README.md)

## Structs vs. Classes
Structs and classes are both used to model real-world entities, but they differ in their default access control and inheritance.
[Read more about Structs vs. Classes](./20.StructsVsClasses/README.md)

## Friends of Classes
Friends of classes are functions and classes that have access to the private members of a class.
[Read more about Friends of Classes](./21.FriendsOfClass/README.md)


## Source Code Examples

Each topic is reinforced with source code examples that serve as both teaching aids and practical references for students. These examples aim to encourage learning by doing, providing a hands-on approach to understanding OOP concepts.
