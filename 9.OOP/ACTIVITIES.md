### Lab Activity 1: Exploring Classes and Objects
- **Objective**: Understand the concept of classes and objects.
- **Task**: Create a simple `Book` class with attributes like `title`, `author`, and `pageCount`. Instantiate several `Book` objects and print their properties.

### Lab Activity 2: Constructors and Destructors
- **Objective**: Learn how to initialize objects using constructors.
- **Task**: Extend the `Book` class by adding a constructor to initialize the attributes. Also, implement a destructor and observe when it is called.

### Lab Activity 3: Access Modifiers
- **Objective**: Grasp the importance of public and private access modifiers.
- **Task**: Modify the `Book` class by making the attributes private and accessing them through public member functions.

### Lab Activity 4: Encapsulation with Getter and Setter Methods
- **Objective**: Implement encapsulation in class design.
- **Task**: Add getter and setter methods to the `Book` class to safely manipulate the private attributes.

### Lab Activity 5: Member Methods
- **Objective**: Write and utilize member methods within a class.
- **Task**: Create a `Rectangle` class and implement methods to calculate the area and perimeter. Create objects and call the methods to print results.

### Lab Activity 6: Operator Overloading
- **Objective**: Learn how to overload operators.
- **Task**: Overload the `+` operator in the `Rectangle` class to combine two rectangle areas into a larger rectangle.

### Lab Activity 7: Composition
- **Objective**: Understand how classes can be composed of other classes.
- **Task**: Design a `Library` class that contains a collection of `Book` objects and demonstrate adding, removing, and listing books.

### Lab Activity 8: Inheritance
- **Objective**: Explore the concept of inheritance.
- **Task**: Create a `GraphicNovel` class that inherits from `Book` and adds specific attributes like `illustrator`.

### Lab Activity 9: Polymorphism
- **Objective**: Implement polymorphism with virtual functions.
- **Task**: Introduce a virtual `printInfo` method in the `Book` class and override it in `GraphicNovel`. Use pointers to `Book` objects to call the method and observe dynamic binding.

### Lab Activity 10: Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- **Objective**: Use abstract classes and pure virtual functions.
- **Task**: Define an `IReadable` interface with a pure virtual `read` method. Implement this interface in the `Book` and `GraphicNovel` classes and invoke the method on a collection of `IReadable` pointers.
