### Activity 1: Pointer Initialization and Usage
**Objective**: Understand how to declare, initialize, and use pointers.
- Write a program where you declare an int variable, initialize it, and then declare a pointer to this variable. Use the pointer to change the value of the int variable and print it out.

### Activity 2: Array Traversal with Pointers
**Objective**: Learn to traverse arrays using pointers instead of array indices.
- Create an array of floats and initialize it with some values. Write a function that uses a pointer to sum the elements of the array. Print the total in the main function.

### Activity 3: Pointer to Pointer
**Objective**: Understand the concept of a pointer to a pointer.
- Write a function that takes a pointer to a pointer to an int. In `main`, declare an int and a pointer to it, and pass the pointer to your function. Modify the original int via the pointer to a pointer.

### Activity 4: Dynamic Memory Allocation for a Matrix
**Objective**: Practice dynamic memory allocation and deallocation with pointers.
- Dynamically allocate a 2D array (matrix) of integers using pointers. Fill it with data, print the matrix, and then deallocate the memory properly.

### Activity 5: Implementing a Linked List
**Objective**: Use pointers to create a simple linked list data structure.
- Define a `Node` structure with an int value and a pointer to the next node. Write functions to add a node to the list, print the entire list, and delete the list.

### Activity 6: Reverse an Array with Pointers
**Objective**: Use pointers to reverse an array in-place.
- Write a function that reverses a given array of integers using pointers. The function should take two pointers, one pointing to the start of the array and one to the end.

### Activity 7: Passing Pointers to Functions
**Objective**: Understand how to pass pointers to functions to modify variable values.
- Write two functions, one that squares a number and another that cubes a number. Pass int values to these functions using pointers and print the results.

### Activity 8: Function Pointers for Sorting
**Objective**: Use function pointers to pass comparison functions to a sorting algorithm.
- Implement a simple bubble sort function that takes a function pointer for the comparison criteria. Write two different comparison functions to sort an array in ascending and descending order.

<!-- ### Activity 9: Smart Pointer Usage
**Objective**: Learn to use smart pointers to manage resources.
- Create a small program that uses `std::unique_ptr` to handle memory for an array. Implement a function that populates the array with data and another function that processes the data. -->

### Activity 10: Pointer Arithmetic Challenges
**Objective**: Master pointer arithmetic operations.
- Given a start pointer to an array and an int value `n`, write a function that returns a new pointer pointing `n` elements forward. Write a second function that returns the distance between two pointers pointing to elements of the same array.
