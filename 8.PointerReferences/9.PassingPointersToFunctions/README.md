# Passing Pointer To Functions in C++

Passing pointers to functions is a crucial aspect of C++ programming. It allows for efficient data manipulation, minimizes memory usage by avoiding data copying, and provides a way to reflect changes made inside the function to the outside world. This guide dives deep into the intricacies of passing pointers to functions in C++.

## Why Pass Pointers?

- **Efficiency**: Passing data by reference, rather than by value, can avoid copying data, saving memory and time.
- **Reflect Changes**: Changes made to the data inside the function can be reflected outside.

## Passing Pointers of Basic Data Types

You can pass a pointer to a function just like any other variable.

```cpp
void modifyValue(int* p) {
    *p = 5;
}
```

## Passing Array Pointers

Arrays are inherently passed as pointers to functions. Thus, modifications in the function reflect in the original array.

```cpp
void modifyArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        arr[i] *= 2;
    }
}
```

## Returning Pointers from Functions

Functions can also return pointers. However, one must be cautious not to return pointers to local variables, as they will be out of scope once the function exits.

```cpp
int* returnPointer(int* p) {
    return p;
}
```

## Potential Pitfalls

- **Dangling Pointers**: Returning pointers to local variables can lead to undefined behavior.
- **Memory Leaks**: Not deallocating dynamically allocated memory after use can lead to memory leaks.

## Examples

1. **Modify Value through Pointer**

```cpp
void modify(int* val) {
    *val = 50;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    modify(&x);
    // x now holds the value 50
}
```

2. **Returning Pointer**

```cpp
int* getMax(int* a, int* b) {
    return (*a > *b) ? a : b;
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Passing pointers to functions is efficient as it avoids data copying.
2. Modifications to the data through pointers in the function reflect outside the function.
3. Be cautious when returning pointers from functions to avoid dangling pointers.
4. Always deallocate dynamically allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
