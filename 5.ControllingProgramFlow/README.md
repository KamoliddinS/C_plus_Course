# Controlling Program Flow
In programming, controlling program flow refers to the ability to direct the execution of code based on specific conditions or loops. It allows you to make decisions, repeat actions, and navigate through your code logically. Controlling program flow is crucial for creating dynamic and responsive software that can adapt to various scenarios.

## Topics Covered

### 1. [If Statements](1.IfStatement/README.md)
If statements are used to make decisions in code. They allow you to execute a block of code based on a condition. Learn how to use if statements to control the flow of your program.


### 2. [If-Else Statements](2.IfElseStatement/README.md)
if-else statements expand on the basic if statement by providing an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is not met. Explore how to use if-else statements for more complex decision-making.


### 3. [Switch Statements](3.SwitchCaseStatement/README.md)
Switch statements provide a way to select one of many code blocks to be executed. They are often used when you have multiple cases to handle. Discover how to use switch statements for efficient branching in your code.
### 4. [Conditional Operator](./4.ConditionalOpertors/README.md)
Conditional operators, also known as the ternary operator (?:), provide a concise way to express conditional statements. Learn how to use the conditional operator for inline decision-making.
### 5. [Looping]( ./5.Looping/README.md)
Loops are essential for repetitive tasks in programming. This section covers various loop constructs in C++ and their applications.
### 6. [For Loop](6.forLoop/README.md)
The for loop is a fundamental loop construct in C++. It allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly with precise control over loop variables. Explore how to use for loops for iteration.
### 7 [Range-based for loop](./7.RangeBasedLoop/README.md)
The range-based for loop is a modern C++ feature that simplifies iteration over collections like arrays and containers. Discover how to use the range-based for loop for efficient iteration.
### 8. [While Loop](./8.WhileLoop/README.md)
The while loop is a basic loop construct that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true. Learn how to use while loops for iteration.
### 9. [Dowhile Loop](./9.DoWhileLoop/README.md)
The do-while loop is useful when you want to ensure that a block of code is executed at least once before checking the loop condition. Learn how to use do-while loops effectively.
### 10. [ Continue and Break](./10.ContinueAndBreak/README.md)
The continue and break statements allow you to control the flow within loops. continue skips the rest of the loop's current iteration, while break exits the loop prematurely. Explore how to use these statements for flow control.

### 11. [Infinite Loops](./11.InfiniteLoops/README.md)
Infinite loops occur when a loop continues indefinitely. This section discusses the causes of infinite loops and how to handle them in your code.

### 12. [Nested Loops](./12.NestedLoops/README.md)
Nested loops are loops within loops. They are used for complex iterations, such as working with two-dimensional arrays or multi-level data structures. Learn how to structure and manage nested loops effectively.

## Conclusion
In this section, you've explored various aspects of controlling program flow in C++. You've learned how to make decisions with if and switch statements, manage loops for repetitive tasks, and handle flow control within loops. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing efficient and structured C++ programs. Continue building on these fundamentals to become a proficient C++ programmer.
