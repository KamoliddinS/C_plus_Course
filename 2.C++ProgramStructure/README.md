# C++ Programming Structure and Fundamental Types

Welcome to the C++ programming Structure and Fundametal types guide! This README is designed to provide a brief overview of some fundamental concepts in C++ programming stucture and fundamental types. Each topic is linked to a detailed explanation to help you dive deeper and understand better. If you're new to programming or if English isn't your first language, don't worry! We've tried to keep things simple and straightforward.

## Table of Contents

1. **C++ Programming Structure**: Before you start writing code, it's essential to understand how a C++ program is structured. This section will give you a bird's-eye view of the components that make up a C++ program. [Read more here](./1.C++_ProgramStructure/OVERVIEW.md).

2. **Include PreProcessor Directive**: In C++, we often need to include external files in our program. The `#include` directive helps us do just that. Learn about its significance and how to use it. [Dive into details here](./2.IncludePreprocessorDirective/INCLUDE_DIRECTIVE.md).

3. **Main Function**: Every C++ program begins its execution from the `main()` function. It's the heart of your program. Discover what it does and why it's so crucial. [Explore more here](./3.MainFunction/MAIN_FUNCTION.md).

4. **Namespaces**: Namespaces help us organize our code and avoid naming conflicts. They're like containers for our code components. [Learn more about namespaces here](./4.Namespaces/NAMESPACES.md).

5. **Fundamental Types**: C++ offers a variety of data types, from integers to characters to floating-point numbers. Understand the basics of these types and when to use them. [Read in detail here](./5.FundamentalTypes/FUNDAMENTAL_TYPES.md).

6. **Basic Input and Output**: Interacting with users is a core part of programming. Learn how to take input from users and display output using `cin` and `cout`. [Discover more here](./6.BasicInputAndOutput/BASICINPUTANDOUTPU.md).
7. **1's and 2's Complement**: Computers use binary numbers to store data. Learn how to represent negative numbers in binary using 1's and 2's complement. [Read more here](./7.1s2sCompliment/README.md).

## Conclusion

If you're feeling overwhelmed, that's okay! Start with the first topic and take your time. Programming is a skill, and like any other skill, it requires practice and patience. As you progress through each topic, try to write small programs to test your understanding. And always remember, every programmer was once a beginner.
