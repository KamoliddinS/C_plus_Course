# Structure of a C++ Program

Welcome to the guide on the structure of a C++ program. This document provides an overview of the fundamental components and organization of a typical C++ program.

## Basic Structure

A C++ program consists of one or more source files (`.cpp` extensions). Each source file contains:

1. **Headers/Includes**: These are files that provide declarations for functions, classes, and variables that can be used in the program. They typically have a `.h` or `.hpp` extension.

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```

2. **Main Function**: Every C++ program must have a `main` function. It's the entry point where the program starts execution.

   ```cpp
   int main() {
       // code
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Function Definitions**: A C++ program can contain multiple functions. These functions are defined with a return type, name, parameters, and a body.

   ```cpp
   void displayMessage() {
       std::cout << "Hello, C++!";
   }
   ```

4. **Class Definitions**: If the program is using object-oriented programming, it will contain class definitions.

   ```cpp
   class MyClass {
       int data;
   public:
       void setData(int d) {
           data = d;
       }
   };
   ```

5. **Global and Local Variables**: Variables can be defined globally (outside any function or class) or locally (inside functions or classes).

6. **Comments**: Comments are used to describe the code and are ignored by the compiler.

   ```cpp
   // This is a single-line comment
   
   /* 
   This is a 
   multi-line comment
   */
   ```

## Program Flow

1. **Sequential Execution**: By default, statements in C++ are executed sequentially from top to bottom.

2. **Control Structures**: These alter the flow of execution. Examples include `if`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, and more.

3. **Function Calls**: When a function is called, the flow of execution moves to that function. Once the function completes, execution returns to the point where the function was called.

## Compilation and Linking

1. **Compilation**: The C++ compiler translates the source code into machine code, producing an object file (`.o` or `.obj` extension).

2. **Linking**: The linker combines multiple object files and external libraries to produce the final executable.

## Conclusion

Understanding the basic structure and flow of a C++ program is crucial for effective programming. This guide provides a foundational overview, and as you delve deeper into C++, you'll encounter more advanced structures and concepts.
