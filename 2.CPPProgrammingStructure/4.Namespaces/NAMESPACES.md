# Namespaces in C++

Namespaces in C++ are used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts. They provide a way to encapsulate a set of identifiers, such as classes, functions, and variables, so that they can be used without interfering with similar identifiers in other parts of the program.

## Overview

A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope for the identifiers inside it. It allows for the organization of code in a way that reduces the likelihood of naming collisions.

## Defining a Namespace

You can define a namespace using the `namespace` keyword:

```cpp
namespace MyNamespace {
    int myVar = 10;
    void myFunction() {
        // function code
    }
}
```

## Accessing Namespace Members

To access the members of a namespace, you use the scope resolution operator `::`:

```cpp
int x = MyNamespace::myVar;
MyNamespace::myFunction();
```

## Using Directive

The `using` directive allows you to bring the entire namespace into the current scope, eliminating the need for the scope resolution operator:

```cpp
using namespace MyNamespace;

int y = myVar;  // No need for MyNamespace:: prefix
myFunction();
```

However, be cautious when using this directive, as it can lead to naming conflicts if two namespaces have members with the same name.

## Nested Namespaces

Namespaces can be nested within other namespaces:

```cpp
namespace Outer {
    namespace Inner {
        int innerVar = 20;
    }
}
```

To access `innerVar`, you'd use `Outer::Inner::innerVar`.

## Anonymous Namespaces

An anonymous namespace is a namespace without a name. Variables, functions, and types declared in an anonymous namespace have internal linkage, which means they can only be accessed within the same file:

```cpp
namespace {
    int anonymousVar = 30;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << anonymousVar << std::endl;  // Accessible here
}
```

## Inline Namespaces (C++11)

Introduced in C++11, inline namespaces allow members of an inline namespace to be used as if they were part of the enclosing namespace:

```cpp
namespace Outer {
    inline namespace Inner {
        int inlineVar = 40;
    }
}

int z = Outer::inlineVar;  // No need for Outer::Inner:: prefix
```

## Conclusion

Namespaces are a powerful feature in C++ that help in organizing code and preventing naming collisions. By understanding and using namespaces effectively, you can write cleaner, more modular, and conflict-free code.
