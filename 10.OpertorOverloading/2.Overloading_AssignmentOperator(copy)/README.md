# Overloading the Assignment Operator in C++

This part of the repository focuses on the concept of overloading the assignment operator in C++. The assignment operator is a fundamental component in C++ that handles copying values from one object to another. Custom overloading of this operator is essential when your class deals with dynamic memory allocation.

## Overview

Overloading the assignment operator allows you to define the copy semantics of objects of your class. This is critical when your class manages resources that are not handled by built-in types, such as dynamic memory or file handles.

## Objectives

- Understand why the default assignment operator may not be sufficient for classes with dynamic resources.
- Learn to implement an assignment operator that correctly copies the value of an object, ensuring no resource leaks and proper deep copies.
- Explore the concept of self-assignment and how to guard against it.
- Study best practices, such as the copy-and-swap idiom.

## Assignment Operator Basics

The assignment operator is used to copy the values from one object to another already existing object. By default, C++ creates a shallow copy. Overloading allows for a deep copy, which is often necessary for managing dynamically allocated memory.

## Syntax and Rules

- The assignment operator must be a non-static member function.
- The operator can be called explicitly or implicitly.
- It typically returns a reference to `*this` to allow for chaining of assignments.

## Code Example

Below is a simple example of how to overload the assignment operator for a class `Widget`.

```cpp
class Widget {
public:
    Widget& operator=(const Widget& rhs) {
        if (this != &rhs) {
            // Free the existing resource
            delete resource;
            // Allocate and copy the resource from the right-hand side object
            resource = new ResourceType(*rhs.resource);
        }
        // Return a reference to the current object
        return *this;
    }

private:
    ResourceType* resource;
};
```

This is a basic example and doesn't handle exceptions safely. For production code, consider using copy-and-swap idiom or the rule of three/five.
