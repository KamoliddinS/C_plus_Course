### Lab Activity 1: Introduction to Operator Overloading
**Objective:** Understand the basic concept of operator overloading and its use cases.
**Task:** Create a class `Counter` and overload the `++` operator to increment the counter value.

### Lab Activity 2: Overloading Unary Operators
**Objective:** Learn to overload unary operators for custom behavior.
**Task:** Overload the `--` (decrement) operator for the `Counter` class from Lab 1.

### Lab Activity 3: Overloading the Copy Assignment Operator
**Objective:** Implement deep copying using the copy assignment operator.
**Task:** Create a class `Matrix` with dynamic memory allocation and overload the `=` operator to perform a deep copy.

### Lab Activity 4: Overloading the Move Assignment Operator
**Objective:** Implement efficient object transfers using the move semantics.
**Task:** Modify the `Matrix` class to include an overload of the move assignment operator that transfers ownership of resources.

### Lab Activity 5: Overloading Binary Arithmetic Operators as Member Functions
**Objective:** Overload operators as class member functions for arithmetic operations.
**Task:** Overload the `+` and `-` operators in the `Matrix` class to allow for matrix addition and subtraction.

### Lab Activity 6: Overloading Binary Arithmetic Operators as Global Functions
**Objective:** Overload operators as global functions to handle arithmetic between different types.
**Task:** Overload the `*` operator to perform multiplication between a `Matrix` object and a scalar value as a global function.

### Lab Activity 7: Overloading the Stream Insertion Operator
**Objective:** Overload the `<<` operator for custom object output formatting.
**Task:** Overload the stream insertion operator to output the contents of a `Matrix` object in a formatted manner.

### Lab Activity 8: Overloading the Stream Extraction Operator
**Objective:** Overload the `>>` operator for custom object input.
**Task:** Overload the stream extraction operator to input values into a `Matrix` object.

### Lab Activity 9: Overloading Subscript Operators for a Container Class
**Objective:** Overload the subscript operators to access elements in a custom container.
**Task:** Create a class `ArrayWrapper` and overload the `[]` operator to access elements as if the class were an array.

### Lab Activity 10: Overloading Comparison Operators
**Objective:** Learn to overload comparison operators for user-defined types.
**Task:** Overload the `==` and `!=` operators for the `Matrix` class to compare two matrices for equality and inequality.
