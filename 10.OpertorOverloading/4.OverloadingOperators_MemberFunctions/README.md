# Overloading Operators as Member Functions

In C++ programming, operators can be overloaded to provide more intuitive and natural syntax when using custom types. Operator overloading can be implemented as member functions or as non-member functions. This section focuses on operator overloading as member functions.

## Overview

When an operator is overloaded as a member function, it is used to give the operator a meaning when applied to instances of the class. The operator is defined similarly to any other member function, which allows it to access the private and protected members of the class.

## Objectives

- Understand the syntax for overloading operators as member functions.
- Learn which operators can be overloaded as member functions.
- Study examples of overloaded operators and how they integrate with object-oriented design.

## Syntax for Overloading an Operator

Here is the general syntax for overloading an operator as a member function:

```cpp
ReturnType operatorX(ArgumentList) {
    // ... implementation ...
}
```

- `ReturnType` is typically a reference to the class type for assignment operators, and for other operators, it might be a value, reference, or a boolean, depending on the semantics of the operator being overloaded.
- `operatorX` is the keyword `operator` followed by the symbol for the operator you want to overload (e.g., `operator+`, `operator==`, etc.).
- `ArgumentList` is the list of arguments the operator takes. For binary operators, there is usually one argument, and for unary operators, there are none.

## Rules and Best Practices

- Not all operators can be overloaded, and some have restrictions. For example, `::`, `.*`, `.`, and `?:` cannot be overloaded.
- Operators should mimic the semantics of the built-in types as closely as possible.
- Overloading operators as member functions may not always be the best choice, especially for binary operators that should provide symmetric behavior (e.g., `operator+`).

## Example: Overloading the Plus Operator

Here's how to overload the unary plus operator for a simple `Point` class.

```cpp
class Point {
public:
    Point(int x, int y) : x_(x), y_(y) {}

    // Overloading the unary plus operator
    Point operator+() const {
        return Point(+x_, +y_);
    }

    // ... additional members ...

private:
    int x_;
    int y_;
};
```

This example demonstrates how to define the unary plus operator as a member function, which simply returns a positive copy of the original point.
