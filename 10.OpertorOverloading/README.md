# Computer Programming with C++: Operator Overloading Overview

Welcome to the repository for our Computer Programming with C++ Course, focusing on the topic of operator overloading.

## What is Operator Overloading?

Operator overloading is a feature in C++ that allows developers to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types (such as classes). By overloading an operator, you can specify the operations that will be performed when the operator is used with instances of your class, enabling operations that are intuitive and similar to those built-in types.

## Why Learn Operator Overloading?

Understanding operator overloading enhances your ability to:

- Implement custom types that behave like fundamental types.
- Write more readable and maintainable code by using familiar operators.
- Use operators with specific semantics for your class, making the code intuitive.

## Topics Covered

- **Basics of Operator Overloading**: How to overload an operator, rules, and syntax.
- **Unary Operators**: Overloading operators like `++`, `--`, `!`.
- **Binary Operators**: Overloading operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `!=`.
- **Assignment Operators**: Overloading the assignment operator `=`.
- **Subscript Operators**: Overloading `[]` for accessing elements in a class that represents a collection.
- **Comparison Operators**: How to properly overload `==`, `<`, `>`, and others for class comparisons.
- **Stream Insertion and Extraction Operators**: Overloading `<<` and `>>` for input and output operations.

## Resources

- **Examples**: Directory containing sample code demonstrating operator overloading.
- **Exercises**: Practice exercises for you to implement what you have learned.
- **Lecture Notes**: Notes and slides from the lectures.
