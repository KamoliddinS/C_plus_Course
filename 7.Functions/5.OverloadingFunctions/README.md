# Overloading Functions in C++

Function overloading allows multiple functions in the same scope to have the same name as long as their parameters are different. This provides flexibility and enhances code readability by allowing a single function name to perform related operations based on different input types or a different number of inputs.

## Understanding Overloading

Function overloading is a feature in C++ where two or more functions can have the same name, but differences in parameters (number, type, or both). The correct function to be invoked is determined at compile-time based on the function call.

## Benefits of Overloading

1. **Improved Code Readability:** A single function name can be used for related operations.
2. **Type Handling:** Different function implementations for different data types, without changing the function name.
3. **Flexibility:** Different implementations can be chosen based on the number or type of arguments.

## Rules for Function Overloading

1. **Parameter Differences:** Overloaded functions must differ in the number or type (or both) of their parameters.
2. **Return Type:** Functions can't be overloaded only based on their return type.
3. **Scope:** Function overloading doesn't depend on function body or return type, but only on the function signature (name and parameters).

## Examples

1. **Overloading Based on Number of Parameters**

```c++
void print(int);
void print(int, int);
```

2. **Overloading Based on Type of Parameters**

```c++
void print(int);
void print(double);
```

3. **Overloading with Different Combinations**

```c++
void print(int, double);
void print(double, int);
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
2. The correct function is chosen at compile-time based on the function call's arguments.
3. Overloading enhances code flexibility and readability by allowing related operations to share a function name.
