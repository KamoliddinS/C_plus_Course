# Scope Rules with Functions in C++

In C++, scope refers to the region or context in which a variable or function is visible and accessible. Understanding scope rules is essential for writing error-free and maintainable code, especially when it comes to functions.

## Function Scope

In C++, functions have their own scope, known as function scope or local scope. Variables declared within a function are only accessible within that function and are not visible outside of it. This is often referred to as "local" or "block" scope.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void myFunction() {
    int x = 10; // Variable 'x' is local to 'myFunction'
    std::cout << "Inside myFunction: x = " << x << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5; // Variable 'x' is local to 'main'
    myFunction(); // Call 'myFunction'
    
    // Attempting to access 'x' from 'myFunction' here would result in an error.
    
    std::cout << "Inside main: x = " << x << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The variable `x` declared inside the `myFunction` function has local scope within `myFunction`. It is only accessible inside that function.

- The variable `x` declared inside the `main` function has local scope within `main`. It is a different variable from the one declared in `myFunction` and is only accessible inside `main`.

- Attempting to access `x` from `myFunction` within the `main` function would result in an error because of the scope rules.

## Function Parameters and Local Variables

Function parameters and local variables declared within a function are in the same scope. They are accessible throughout the entire function, but not outside of it.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printSum(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b; // 'a', 'b', and 'sum' are in the same scope
    std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
    printSum(x, y); // Call 'printSum' with 'x' and 'y'
    
    // Attempting to access 'a', 'b', or 'sum' here would result in an error.
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The parameters `a` and `b` of the `printSum` function, along with the local variable `sum`, are in the same scope within the function. They are accessible only within `printSum`.

- Attempting to access `a`, `b`, or `sum` outside of the `printSum` function would result in an error due to scope rules.

## Global Scope

Variables declared outside of all functions, typically at the top of the source file, have global scope. They are visible and accessible to all functions within the file.

### Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int globalVariable = 100; // Global variable

void printGlobalVariable() {
    std::cout << "Global Variable: " << globalVariable << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    printGlobalVariable(); // Call 'printGlobalVariable' to access the global variable
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- The variable `globalVariable` is declared at the global scope, making it accessible from both the `main` function and the `printGlobalVariable` function.

- The `printGlobalVariable` function can access and display the value of `globalVariable`.

Understanding scope rules is crucial for managing variables, avoiding naming conflicts, and ensuring that your code behaves as expected. It helps you control the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions within your program.
