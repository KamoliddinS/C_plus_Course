# Function Prototypes in C++

In C++, it's essential to inform the compiler about the function details before its actual usage or definition in the code. This is where function prototypes come into play.

## What is a Function Prototype?

A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters, but it does not contain the function body.

## Why Use Function Prototypes?

1. **Compiler Awareness:** It ensures the compiler knows about the function's existence before its call or even before its detailed definition.
2. **Type Checking:** Helps the compiler ensure that functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments.
3. **Better Code Organization:** Allows for separating function declarations and definitions, making the code more readable and modular.

## Writing a Function Prototype

A function prototype follows this basic syntax:
```c++
returnType functionName(parameterType1, parameterType2, ...);
```

Notes:
- The function prototype ends with a semicolon.
- You don't need to give parameter names in the prototype, just their types. However, including names can make the prototype more readable.

## Examples

1. **Simple Prototype**
   ```c++
   int add(int, int);
   ```

   Here, `add` is a function that takes two integers as parameters and returns an integer.

2. **With Parameter Names (More Descriptive)**
   ```c++
   double computeAverage(double sum, int count);
   ```

   The function `computeAverage` takes a double (sum) and an integer (count) and returns a double.

3. **Function with No Parameters**
   ```c++
   void displayMessage();
   ```

   The `displayMessage` function takes no parameters and has no return value (`void`).

## Key Takeaways

1. Function prototypes give the compiler information about a function without providing its actual body.
2. They are beneficial for type checking and code organization.
3. Prototypes can be placed at the beginning of a source file or in header files to be shared among multiple source files.
