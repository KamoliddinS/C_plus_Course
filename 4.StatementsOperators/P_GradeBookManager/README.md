# GradeBook Manager

The GradeBook Manager is a C++ console application designed to help users manage and analyze students' grades for a course. This project is a great starting point for beginners looking to apply foundational C++ concepts.

## Features

- **Add Students**: Input student names along with their corresponding grades.
- **Display Students**: View all student names and their respective grades.
- **Statistics**:
  - Calculate the average grade for the class.
  - Display the highest grade achieved.
  - Display the lowest grade achieved.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

### Compilation and Execution

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o gradebook_manager main.cpp
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./gradebook_manager
   ```

## Usage

Upon launching the program, you will encounter a menu with various options related to the GradeBook Manager functionalities. Follow the on-screen prompts for each menu option.

## Learning Objectives

With this project, students will:

- Grasp the use of C++ data structures, specifically vectors.
- Learn basic input and output operations with `cin` and `cout`.
- Apply loops and conditional statements in a practical scenario.
- Understand the use of structures to represent complex data.
- Implement and use functions to modularize code.

## Possible Enhancements

- Add functionality to modify or delete student grades.
- Implement a search feature to find a particular student's grade.
- Introduce sorting capabilities to list students in order of grades.
- Add error checks for invalid inputs.
