# C++ Operators

Operators are symbols used to perform specific operations on one or more operands (data value). In C++, operators are used to manipulate data and variables.

## Types of Operators in C++

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

These operators are used for arithmetic calculations:

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus (Remainder)

### 2. Relational Operators

These operators are used to compare two values:

- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to

### 3. Logical Operators

Used for logical operations:

- `&&` : Logical AND
- `||` : Logical OR
- `!` : Logical NOT

### 4. Assignment Operators

Used to assign values:

- `=` : Assign
- `+=` : Add and assign
- `-=` : Subtract and assign
- `*=` : Multiply and assign
- `/=` : Divide and assign
- `%=` : Modulus and assign

### 5. Unary Operators

Operate on a single operand:

- `+` : Positive
- `-` : Negative
- `++` : Increment
- `--` : Decrement

### 6. Bitwise Operators

Operate on individual bits of operands:

- `&` : Bitwise AND
- `|` : Bitwise OR
- `^` : Bitwise XOR
- `~` : Bitwise NOT
- `<<` : Left shift
- `>>` : Right shift

### 7. Miscellaneous Operators

- `sizeof` : Returns the size of a variable or data type
- `&` : Returns the address of a variable (Address operator)
- `*` : Pointer to a variable (Pointer operator)
- `::` : Scope resolution operator
- `? :` : Ternary operator

## Conclusion

Understanding operators is crucial in C++ programming. They allow for data manipulation and decision-making in your code. Practice using these operators to become more familiar with their functionality.
