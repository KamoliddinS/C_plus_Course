# Statements and Operators in C++

In C++, statements and operators play a crucial role in defining the structure and behavior of programs. This guide provides an overview of various topics related to statements and operators.

## Topics Covered

### 1. [Expressions and Statements](1.ExpressionsStatements/EXPRESSIONS.md)
Expressions are combinations of variables, constants, and operators that can be evaluated to produce a value. Statements, on the other hand, are complete lines of code that perform some action.

### 2. [Operators](2.Opertors/OPERTORS.md)
Operators are symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical operations.

### 2. [Bitwise Operators](2.BitwiseOpertors/BITWISEOPERTORS.md)
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on individual bits of numbers. They are useful when you want to manipulate data at the bit level.

### 3. [Assignment Operator](3.AssignmentOpertors/ASSIGNMENT.md)
The assignment operator (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.

### 4. [Arithmetic Operators](4.ArithmeticOpertors/ARITHMETIC.md)
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

### 5. [Increment and Decrement Operators](5.IncreamentDecrementOpertors/INCREMENTDECREMENT.md)
These operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.

### 6. [Mixed Expression Conversion](6.MixedExpressionConversion/MIXEDEXPCONVERSION.md)
When different data types are combined in an expression, type conversion occurs to ensure consistent results.

### 7. [Testing for Equality](7.TestingForEquality/TESTINGFOREQUALITY.md)
Understand how to check if two values are equal or not in C++.

### 8. [Relational Operators](8.RelationalOpertors/RELATIONALOPERTORS.md)
Relational operators are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them.

### 9. [Logical Operators](9.LogicalOpertors/LOGICALOPERATOR.md)
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions or to invert the value of a condition.
