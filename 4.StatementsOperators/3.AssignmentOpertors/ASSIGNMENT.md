# C++ Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. In C++, apart from the basic assignment operator (`=`), there are several compound assignment operators that combine arithmetic operations with assignment.

## List of Assignment Operators

- `=` : Assign
- `+=` : Add and assign
- `-=` : Subtract and assign
- `*=` : Multiply and assign
- `/=` : Divide and assign
- `%=` : Modulus and assign

## Usage and Examples

### 1. Assign (`=`)

The `=` operator assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

```cpp
int a;
a = 5; // a is now 5
```

### 2. Add and Assign (`+=`)

The `+=` operator adds the value on its right to the variable on its left and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

```cpp
int a = 5;
a += 3; // a is now 8
```

### 3. Subtract and Assign (`-=`)

The `-=` operator subtracts the value on its right from the variable on its left and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

```cpp
int a = 5;
a -= 3; // a is now 2
```

### 4. Multiply and Assign (`*=`)

The `*=` operator multiplies the variable on its left by the value on its right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

```cpp
int a = 5;
a *= 3; // a is now 15
```

### 5. Divide and Assign (`/=`)

The `/=` operator divides the variable on its left by the value on its right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

```cpp
int a = 15;
a /= 3; // a is now 5
```

### 6. Modulus and Assign (`%=`)

The `%=` operator calculates the modulus of the variable on its left by the value on its right and then assigns the result to the variable on the left.

```cpp
int a = 15;
a %= 4; // a is now 3
```

## Conclusion

Assignment operators in C++ simplify code by combining arithmetic operations with assignment. They are a shorthand way of performing operations and then storing the result in the same variable. Practice using these operators to become more familiar with their functionality.
