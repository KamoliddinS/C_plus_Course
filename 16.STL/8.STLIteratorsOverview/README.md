# STL Iterators in C++

## Introduction
Iterators are a fundamental part of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. They act as a bridge between containers and algorithms, allowing the latter to work on a wide variety of data structures. In this section, we'll explore the different types of iterators in STL and their use cases.

## Types of Iterators
STL defines several types of iterators, each with different capabilities:

1. **Input Iterators**: Allow reading from a sequence of elements.
2. **Output Iterators**: Allow writing to a sequence of elements.
3. **Forward Iterators**: Combine the functionality of input and output iterators and can move forward through a sequence (one step at a time).
4. **Bidirectional Iterators**: Like forward iterators but can also move backwards.
5. **Random Access Iterators**: Offer all the functionality of bidirectional iterators, plus direct access to any element in the sequence.

## Iterator Operations
Iterators support various operations, depending on their type:

- **Incrementing (`++iterator`)**: Moves to the next element.
- **Decrementing (`--iterator`)**: Moves to the previous element (only for bidirectional and random access iterators).
- **Dereferencing (`*iterator`)**: Accesses the value of the element pointed to by the iterator.
- **Accessing Members (`iterator->member`)**: Accesses member of the element (if it's a pointer or an object with members).
- **Arithmetic Operations (`iterator + n`, `iterator - n`)**: Moves the iterator forward or backward by `n` positions (only for random access iterators).

## Examples
(Include practical code examples demonstrating how to use different types of iterators, such as iterating over a `vector`, modifying elements using iterators, or using algorithms with iterators.)

## Best Practices
- Choose the right type of iterator for the task. For example, use random access iterators for containers like `vector` and `deque` where you need to access elements non-sequentially.
- Be cautious of iterator invalidation, where iterators may become invalid due to operations like insertion or deletion.
