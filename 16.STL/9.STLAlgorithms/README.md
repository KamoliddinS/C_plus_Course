## Introduction
STL algorithms are a collection of functions provided by the C++ Standard Template Library to perform various operations on containers. They act on ranges of elements and are largely independent of the actual type of container used. This section provides an overview of key STL algorithms and their usage.

## Key Algorithm Categories
STL algorithms can be classified into several categories based on their purpose and functionality:

1. **Non-modifying Sequence Operations**: Algorithms that do not alter the elements in the container. Examples include `find`, `count`, `accumulate`, and `equal`.

2. **Modifying Sequence Operations**: Algorithms that modify the elements in the container. Examples include `copy`, `transform`, `replace`, and `fill`.

3. **Partitioning Operations**: Used to rearrange elements based on a predicate. Examples are `partition` and `stable_partition`.

4. **Sorting Operations**: Include not only `sort`, but also `partial_sort`, `nth_element`, and sorting-related operations like `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`, and `binary_search`.

5. **Numeric Operations**: Algorithms for numerical processing such as `accumulate`, `inner_product`, and `adjacent_difference`.

6. **Heap Operations**: Algorithms to manage a heap within a container, like `make_heap`, `push_heap`, `pop_heap`, and `sort_heap`.

## Examples
(Include practical code examples for each category of algorithms. Demonstrating basic use cases such as sorting a vector, finding elements, or applying operations like accumulate or transform.)

## Best Practices
- Use STL algorithms to write more concise, higher-level code that is often more efficient and less error-prone than hand-written loops.
- Prefer lambda expressions for custom operations or predicates with STL algorithms.
