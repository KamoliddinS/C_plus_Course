# Computer Programming with C++ Course - Overview

Welcome to the Computer Programming with C++ Course repository! This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding the fundamental concepts of C++ programming, with a special focus on polymorphism. Below is an overview of the topics we've covered so far:

## Repository Contents

- **Introduction to Polymorphism**
  - A detailed explanation of what polymorphism is and how it's a core concept in object-oriented programming in C++.
  
- **Using a Base Class Pointer**
  - Insight into how base class pointers can be used to achieve polymorphism, enabling dynamic behavior during runtime.

- **Virtual Functions**
  - Understanding virtual functions and how they allow C++ programs to call methods on objects at runtime, depending on their actual derived types rather than what is specified by the base pointer or reference.

- **Virtual Destructors**
  - The importance of virtual destructors in a polymorphic base class to ensure proper resource cleanup and prevent memory leaks.

- **Override Specifier**
  - Explanation of the `override` specifier and how it helps maintain correctness in the presence of polymorphism by indicating that a member function is intended to override a base class function.

- **Final Specifier**
  - How the `final` specifier is used to prevent further derivation from a class or overriding of a virtual function in derived classes.

- **Base Class References**
  - Demonstrates the use of base class references in polymorphism, providing an alternative to pointers for achieving runtime polymorphism.

- **Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes**
  - Understanding the concept of pure virtual functions and abstract classes, and how they are used to define interfaces for derived classes.

## Practical Examples and Code Snippets

Each topic is accompanied by practical code examples and snippets that illustrate the concept in a simple and understandable manner. The examples are designed to demonstrate how polymorphism works in real-world scenarios, making it easier for students to grasp the abstract concepts.
