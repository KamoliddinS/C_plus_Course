# Using the Override Specifier in Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in C++ that allows for calling different function implementations based on the object's type, even when accessed through a base class reference or pointer. The `override` specifier, introduced in C++11, plays an important role in making polymorphic code safer and clearer. This section provides an overview of the `override` specifier and its usage in polymorphism.

## What is the Override Specifier?

The `override` specifier is a keyword that can be added to the declaration of a member function in a derived class to indicate that the function is meant to override a virtual function in the base class.

## Benefits of Using Override

- **Safety**: The compiler checks that the function marked with `override` is indeed overriding a base class function. If not, the compiler will generate an error.
- **Readability**: It becomes clear to readers of the code that the function is an override of a virtual function.
- **Maintenance**: If the base class function is changed in such a way that the derived class no longer overrides it (such as a change in the parameter list), the compiler will flag this as an error, helping to catch potential bugs early in the development process.

## Example of Override in Polymorphism

Consider the following example, where `override` is used to ensure that the derived class's function is correctly overriding the virtual function in the base class:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() const {
        std::cout << "Drawing a shape." << std::endl;
    }
    virtual ~Shape() = default;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {  // Correctly overriding the base class method
        std::cout << "Drawing a circle." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw(int length) const override {  // Error: does not override a base class method
        std::cout << "Drawing a square with side length: " << length << std::endl;
    }
};
```

In this code, `Circle` correctly overrides the `draw` function. However, `Square` attempts to override the `draw` function but mistakenly adds an additional parameter. Because `Square`'s `draw` function is marked with `override`, the compiler will generate an error, alerting the programmer to the issue.

## Key Takeaways

- The `override` specifier is a powerful tool for ensuring that functions are correctly overriding virtual functions in base classes.
- It is a best practice to always use the `override` specifier when writing derived classes in polymorphic hierarchies.
- The specifier aids both the compiler in catching errors and the programmer in understanding the class hierarchy.

## Conclusion

The `override` specifier enhances the polymorphism capabilities of C++, making code more robust and easier to understand. By leveraging this feature, programmers can write more reliable and maintainable object-oriented code.
