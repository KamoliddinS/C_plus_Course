# Virtual Functions and Polymorphism in C++

This section of our Computer Programming with C++ course repository focuses on virtual functions and their role in enabling polymorphism. Understanding virtual functions is crucial for implementing runtime polymorphism, which allows objects to behave differently based on their actual derived types even when accessed through a pointer or reference of the base class type.

## What are Virtual Functions?

Virtual functions are member functions of a class that can be overridden in its derived classes. When you declare a function as virtual in a base class, you are telling the compiler to support polymorphism for that method.

## How Virtual Functions Enable Polymorphism

When a base class reference or pointer calls a virtual function, C++ determines which function to invoke at runtime based on the actual type of the object that the pointer or reference is pointing to, not the type of the pointer/reference itself.

## Declaring Virtual Functions

A virtual function is declared by using the `virtual` keyword in the base class. This makes the function polymorphic and it can be overridden in any derived class.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {
        std::cout << "Base class show" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

## Overriding Virtual Functions

A derived class overrides a virtual function to provide its own specific implementation.

```cpp
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {
        std::cout << "Derived class show" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

## Using Virtual Functions

Here's a simple way to use virtual functions:

```cpp
Base* basePtr = new Derived();
basePtr->show();  // Calls Derived's show
delete basePtr;   // Clean up
```

In this example, even though `basePtr` is a pointer to `Base`, it calls the `show` function of `Derived`, because `show` is a virtual function and `basePtr` actually points to an instance of `Derived`.

## Why Use Virtual Functions?

Virtual functions are essential for:

- **Runtime Polymorphism**: They allow objects to be treated as objects of the base class while behaving like objects of the derived class.
- **Dynamic Binding**: They ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the expression type the object is accessed by.

## Key Points to Remember

- A virtual function in the base class suggests that it can be overridden in the derived class.
- The `virtual` keyword is only required in the declaration inside the base class. It's optional (but good practice) to use `override` in derived classes.
- If a derived class does not override a virtual function, the version in the base class is used.
- Always declare destructors as virtual in polymorphic base classes.

## Conclusion

Virtual functions are a powerful feature of C++ that enable flexible and maintainable code through polymorphism. They are an essential part of object-oriented design and allow for more generalized and reusable code.
