# Building a C++ Program from Source to Executable

The process of building a C++ program can be broken down into a series of steps. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Preprocessing**
    - This stage involves expanding macros, including header files, and performing conditional compilation. The preprocessor takes the source code (`*.cpp` file) and produces an intermediate expanded source code.
    
    - *Directive Expansion*: The preprocessor interprets preprocessor directives such as `#include`, `#define`, and `#ifdef`. It's also during this stage that header files are included, so if you've got a `#include "somefile.h"`, the content of "somefile.h" will be included in the source code.
    - *Macro Expansion*: If there are any macros (created using `#define`) in the code, they will be expanded. For instance, `#define PI 3.14159` would replace all instances of `PI` in the code with `3.14159`.
    - *Conditional Compilation*: Directives like `#ifdef`, `#else`, and `#endif` allow for parts of the code to be compiled conditionally based on certain conditions.


2. **Compilation**
    - During this stage, the expanded source code is translated into assembly code by the compiler. The output of this phase is an assembly code file, typically with a `.s` or `.asm` extension.

    - *Syntax Checking*: The compiler checks the syntax of the source code. If there are any syntax errors, the compilation process will halt.
    - *Translation to Assembly*: The compiler will translate the high-level C++ code into assembly code. This isn't machine code yet, but a lower-level representation of the program.
    - *Optimization*: Modern compilers can optimize the assembly code, improving its performance or reducing its size.



3. **Assembly**
    - The assembly code is then converted into machine code by the assembler. This produces an object file, typically with a `.o` or `.obj` extension.

    - The assembler translates the assembly code into machine code. Machine code is a series of binary instructions that can be directly executed by the CPU.
    - Each `.s` or `.asm` file gets translated into a corresponding `.o` or `.obj` file.

4. **Linking**
    - The linker combines one or more object files with libraries to produce the final executable. The output is typically a binary file with a `.exe` (for Windows) or no extension (for UNIX/Linux) which is ready to be executed.

    - *Resolving References*: The linker's main job is to resolve references between object files. If you've defined a function in one file and used it in another, the linker makes sure they are correctly connected.
    - *Static Libraries*: If you're using any static libraries (like the C++ standard library), the linker will include parts of these libraries in the final executable.
    - *Dynamic Libraries*: For dynamic libraries (like DLLs on Windows or shared objects on Linux), the linker doesn't include them in the executable. Instead, it ensures that the executable knows where to find and load them during runtime.
    - *Output*: The final result is an executable file. On Windows, it's typically a `.exe` file, while on UNIX/Linux systems, it's a binary file without an extension.
