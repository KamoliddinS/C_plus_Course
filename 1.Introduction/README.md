# C++  Introduction Project Guide

Welcome to the C++ Project Guide. This document provides a brief overview of various aspects of C++ development, from setting up and running your project to understanding different types of errors you could face.

## 1. Project Setup and Naming Conventions
- **Setting Up a development environment**: To get started with C++ development, you'll need to set up a development environment. For a detailed guide, see [Setting Up a Development Environment](./SETUP.md).

- **Building and Compiling**: Under the hood, C++ is a compiled language. This means that your source code is converted into machine code before it's executed. For a detailed guide, see [Building and Compiling](./BUILDINGAC++PROGRAM.md).

- **CMakeLists and Makefile**: These are essential files for building and compiling your C++ project. They define how your source files are compiled, linked, and turned into executable programs. For a detailed guide, see [CMakeLists and Makefile Guide](./1.HelloWorld/C++INTRO.md).
  
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming conventions are crucial for code readability and maintainability. For an in-depth look at naming conventions in C++, check out our [Naming Conventions Guide](./1.HelloWorld/C++INTRO.md?plain=1#L90).

- **Running the Code**: To understand how to compile and run your C++ code, refer to the [Running the Code Guide](./1.HelloWorld/HOWTO.md).

## 2. Compiler Feedback

- **Compiler Errors and Warnings**: These messages from the compiler indicate issues in your code that need to be addressed before your program can run. For a comprehensive understanding, see [Compiler Errors and Warnings Guide](./2.CompilerErrorWarnings/COMPILER_ERRORS_WARNING.md).

## 3. Linker Errors

- **Linker Errors**: After compilation, the linker combines the compiled source files. If it encounters issues, it will produce linker errors. Dive deeper into this topic with our [Linker Errors Guide](./3.LinkerError/LINKER_ERRORS.md).

## 4. Runtime Errors

- **Runtime Errors**: These errors occur when your program is executed. They can be due to various reasons, from invalid operations to unexpected input. Learn more in the [Runtime Errors Guide](./4.RuntimeError/RUNTIME_ERRORS.md).

## 5. Logic Errors

- **Logic Errors**: Even if your code compiles and runs without errors, it might not produce the expected output due to flaws in logic. Explore common logic errors and how to identify them in the [Logic Errors Guide](./5.LogicError/LOGIC_ERRORS.md).

## Conclusion

This guide provides a starting point for understanding the different aspects of C++ development. By diving into each linked document, you can gain a deeper understanding of each topic. Happy coding!
