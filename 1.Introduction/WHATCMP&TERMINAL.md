# Command Prompt & Terminal: A Simple Guide

## What are they?

Both the Command Prompt and Terminal are tools that allow users to interact with their computer using text commands. Instead of clicking on icons or using a mouse, you type commands to perform tasks.

### Command Prompt (Windows)

- **Name**: Command Prompt
- **Operating System**: Windows
- **Icon**: A black box, sometimes with a white "C:\>" symbol.
- **Purpose**: It's a place where you can run commands to control your computer, run programs, and manage files.

### Terminal (Linux/Mac)

- **Name**: Terminal (On Mac, it's also called "Terminal". On Linux, it might be called "Console" or "Shell".)
- **Operating System**: Linux and Mac
- **Icon**: Usually a black box or a black screen icon.
- **Purpose**: Just like the Command Prompt in Windows, the Terminal lets you control your computer by typing commands.

## Why use them?

1. **Speed**: Once you know the commands, it can be faster than using a mouse.
2. **Power**: Some tasks can only be done (or are easier to do) using the Command Prompt or Terminal.
3. **Programming**: As a computer programming student, you'll often use these tools to compile and run your programs.

## Basic Commands

Here are some basic commands you might use:

### Command Prompt (Windows)

- `dir`: Lists all the files in the current directory.
- `cd [directory name]`: Changes the current directory.
- `cls`: Clears the screen.

### Terminal (Linux/Mac)

- `ls`: Lists all the files in the current directory.
- `cd [directory name]`: Changes the current directory.
- `clear`: Clears the screen.

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Don't be afraid**: It might look intimidating at first, but with practice, you'll get the hang of it.
2. **Ask for help**: If you're not sure about a command, ask your teacher or a friend.
3. **Practice**: The more you use the Command Prompt or Terminal, the more comfortable you'll become.
