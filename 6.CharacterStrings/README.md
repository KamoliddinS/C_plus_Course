# Character Strings
Character strings are sequences of characters used to represent text-based data in programming. They are essential for handling textual information within code.

## Topics Covered

### 1. [C-Style Strings](./1.C-StyleStrings/README.md)
C-Style Strings, also known as null-terminated strings, are character arrays terminated by a null character (`'\0'`). Key topics related to C-Style Strings include:

- **Declaration and Initialization:** Creating and initializing C-Style Strings.
- **Access and Modification:** Accessing and modifying individual characters within the string.
- **String Length:** Determining the length of the string.
- **String Concatenation:** Combining multiple C-Style Strings.
- **String Comparison:** Comparing C-Style Strings.
- **Input and Output:** Reading and writing C-Style Strings.
- **Infinite Loops:** Handling potential infinite loops caused by improper string manipulation.


### 2. [C++ Strings](2.C++Strings/README.md)
### C++ Strings

C++ Strings, using the `std::string` class from the C++ Standard Library, provide a more versatile and safer way to work with strings. Key topics related to C++ Strings include:

- **Declaration and Initialization:** Creating and initializing C++ Strings.
- **Access and Modification:** Accessing and modifying individual characters within the string.
- **String Length:** Determining the length of the string.
- **String Concatenation:** Combining multiple C++ Strings.
- **String Comparison:** Comparing C++ Strings.
- **Input and Output:** Reading and writing C++ Strings.
- **Advanced String Operations:** Utilizing built-in functions and features for string manipulation.
- **Best Practices:** Following recommended practices for efficient and safe string handling.


## Conclusion
Understanding both C-Style Strings and C++ Strings is essential for proficient text manipulation and processing in C++ programming.
