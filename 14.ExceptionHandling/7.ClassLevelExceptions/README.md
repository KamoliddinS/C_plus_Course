# Class Level Exceptions

Class-level exceptions are a method of encapsulating the exception handling mechanism within a class. This approach can enhance the modularity and maintainability of exception handling by localizing the concerns of error detection and management within the classes that are responsible for those errors.

## Rationale

Utilizing class-level exceptions allows:

- **Encapsulation**: Keeping the exception-related code within the class that throws them.
- **Reusability**: When a class with its own exceptions is reused, the exceptions are reused automatically.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding the complexity of error handling from the users of the class.

## Designing Class Level Exceptions

When designing exceptions for a class, it's essential to consider:

1. **Which operations could fail**: Constructors, methods, or even destructors could potentially fail and may need to throw exceptions.
2. **What kind of failure could occur**: Different methods might fail for different reasons, and it may be useful to have distinct exception types for each kind of failure.
3. **Inheritance hierarchy**: It can be beneficial for all exceptions in a class hierarchy to inherit from a common base exception specific to that hierarchy.

## Implementing Class Level Exceptions

Implementation involves creating one or more exception classes within or associated with the class that will throw them. Here's a conceptual overview of how it might look:

### Example Class with Its Own Exception

```cpp
class MyResource {
public:
    // Define a nested class-level exception type
    class ResourceException : public std::exception {
    private:
        std::string message;
    public:
        ResourceException(const std::string& msg) : message(msg) {}
        const char* what() const noexcept override {
            return message.c_str();
        }
    };

    MyResource() {
        // Constructor code that might throw a ResourceException
    }

    void doSomething() {
        // Method code that might throw a ResourceException
    }
};
```

In the example above, `MyResource` has a nested `ResourceException` class. This design makes it clear that `ResourceException` is intended to be used solely in conjunction with `MyResource`.

### Using Class Level Exceptions

Using the class and handling its exceptions can be done as follows:

```cpp
int main() {
    try {
        MyResource resource;
        resource.doSomething();
    } catch (const MyResource::ResourceException& e) {
        std::cerr << "MyResource error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The `main` function demonstrates how to catch class-level exceptions. The catch block specifically handles exceptions of the type `MyResource::ResourceException`.

## Benefits of Class Level Exceptions

- **Clarity**: The origin and context of an exception are clearer because the exception is tied to the class.
- **Maintainability**: As the class evolves, its exceptions can be modified in parallel without affecting other parts of the codebase.
- **Safety**: Sensitive information can be protected by carefully controlling what is included in the exception message.

## Conclusion

Class-level exceptions are a structured way to manage errors in object-oriented programming. By defining exceptions that are specific to a class, you can create a more robust and self-contained error-handling strategy that is easier to understand and maintain.
